                <h1>Behaviorism</h1>
                <h2>Background and Overview</h2>
                <p><b></b>Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still
                    be
                    felt today. Early work in the field was conducted by John B. Watson at the beginning of the 20th
                    century after important preliminary work by Ivan Pavlov and E. L. Thorndike and was popularised and
                    radicalised in equal measure by B. F. Skinner in the 1950s. Behaviorists rejected the formerly
                    popular introspectionist methods and instead focused on objectively observable, quantifiable events
                    and behavior. Through its objective methods and experimentation, Behaviorism was also largely
                    responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline (Dumper et al., n.d.)</p>
                <h2>Classical Conditioning </h2>
                <hr />
                <p><em>Learning that occurs when a neutral, novel stimulus becomes associated with a natural,
                        unconditioned stimulus that produces a behaviour / desired response.</em></p>
                <hr />
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Ivan_Pavlov_LIFE.jpg" alt="" /></span>Early work in the
                    field was conducted by the Russian physiologist <strong>Ivan Pavlov</strong> (1849-1936). Pavlov conducted a series of
                    experiments in which dogs were exposed to a sound immediately before receiving their food and
                    recorded the amount of the dogsâ€™ salivation. Initially the dogs salivated only when they saw or
                    smelled the food, but after several pairings of the sound and the food, the dogs began to salivate
                    as soon as they heard the sound without being exposed to food. The animals had learned to associate
                    the sound with the food that followed. Pavlov had identified a fundamental associative learning
                    process called classical conditioning (Stangor & Walina, 2014).
