                <h1>Behaviorism</h1>
                <h2>Background and Overview</h2>
                <p><b></b>Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still
                    be
                    felt today. Early work in the field was conducted by John B. Watson at the beginning of the 20th
                    century after important preliminary work by Ivan Pavlov and E. L. Thorndike and was popularised and
                    radicalised in equal measure by B. F. Skinner in the 1950s. Behaviorists rejected the formerly
                    popular introspectionist methods and instead focused on objectively observable, quantifiable events
                    and behavior. Through its objective methods and experimentation, Behaviorism was also largely
                    responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline (Dumper et al., n.d.)</p>
                <h2>Classical Conditioning </h2>
                <hr />
                <p><em>Learning that occurs when a neutral, novel stimulus becomes associated with a natural,
                        unconditioned stimulus that produces a behaviour / desired response.</em></p>
                <hr />
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Ivan_Pavlov_LIFE.jpg" alt="" /></span>Early work in the
                    field was conducted by the Russian physiologist <strong>Ivan Pavlov</strong> (1849-1936). Pavlov
                    conducted a series of
                    experiments in which dogs were exposed to a sound immediately before receiving their food and
                    recorded the amount of the dogs’ salivation. Initially the dogs salivated only when they saw or
                    smelled the food, but after several pairings of the sound and the food, the dogs began to salivate
                    as soon as they heard the sound without being exposed to food. The animals had learned to associate
                    the sound with the food that followed. Pavlov had identified a fundamental associative learning
                    process called classical conditioning (Stangor & Walina, 2014).

                    Extinction: if the CS is repeatedly presented alone -> the behaviour slowly decreases

                    Spontaneous recovery: after a pause, when the CS is again presented alone, the behaviour may again
                    occur and then again show extinction

                    Stimulus Generalization: when a stimulus similar to an already-conditioned stimulus begins to
                    produce the same response as the original stimulus (e.g. a dog being conditioned to being scratched
                    before the food arrived, responded also with salivation when he was scrubbed)

                    Stimulus Discrimination: when the organism learns to differentiate between the CS and other similar
                    stimuli

                    Second-order conditioning: a neutral stimulus becomes CS after being paired with a previously
                    established CS

                    Some stimuli-response pairs (like smell + food) are more easily conditioned (evolution)

                <p>In a classroom context we can think about the following example:
                    when presented with a math flashcard showing the equation “2 + 4 = ?” the learner replies with the
                    answer of “6.” The equation is the stimulus and the proper answer is the associated response.
                    The key elements are the stimulus, the response, and the association between the two. Of primary
                    concern is how the association between the stimulus and response is made, strengthened, and
                    maintained. (Ertmer et al., 2018)

                <hr />
                <p><em>Consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior (Andover, 2013). The behavior is shaped using
                        reinforcements or punishments. An animal or human learns from the consequences (reinforcer or
                        punishment) of its own behavior.</em></p>
                <hr />
                <p>American psychologist Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) developed the law of effect: through studying
                    animal behavior, Thorndike found that if a behavior is followed by a desirable outcome the
                    likelihood of engaging in that behavior again is greater. </p>

                <p>B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) expanded on Thorndike’s ideas to develop a set of principles. Skinner’s
                    famous experiment with rats in Skinner boxes showed that rats could learn to respond to stimuli in
                    certain ways to earn food rewards and avoid electrical shocks (Stangor & Walinga, 2015).
